        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <p>I started programming by getting the input of the button. To do that I defined the button pin and LED pins using #define. I also created a variable that holds the state of the button. Now inside the loop function, I use digitalRead to read and save the button state inside the button state variable. Then I use a if condition to turn the LEDs on and off, depending on the button state.</p>
        <p>After uploading it worked right away!</p>
        <p>To clean up the code, I created functions to turn the LEDs on and off. I called these functions inside the if condition.</p>
        <p>Next, I wanted to write the state of the button in the serial. To do that, I created a SoftwareSerial. I used the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SoftwareSerialExample">Arduino Software Serial Example as a reference</a>. Setting up the serial is easy, you just have include the SoftwareSerial using #include. Then you decide on which two pins are RX and TX. Then set up the software serial using SoftwareSerial mySerial(RX, TX). Inside the setup function use mySerial.begin(2400) to open the serial port.</p>
        <p>To test the serial I created a character array which contains a message. I print this message in the serial using a for loop and mySerial.print, also adding a small delay so you can see it being written inside the serial.</p>
        <p>Next up, I need to add more println inside the if condition to show the state of the button. I also added a delay to not flood the serial because software serials are limited in speed.</p>
        <p>This is how the final code looks like.</p>

        <h1>Uploading the code and connecting the board</h1>
        <p>To program the board, be sure to have the ArduinoISP loaded and the bootloader burend onto the board.</p>
        <p>Next step, use the Uploading using Programmer button with the correct settings under tools to upload the code to the custom board.</p>
        <p>Connect the board using FTDI cable, connecting GND (black), RX (yellow) and TX (orange).</p>
        <p>Be also sure to install the drivers for the FTDI cable.</p>
        <p>Next, just plug in the USB end to the computer and open up the Serial Monitor. Disconnect and reconnect to reset the board and see the serial output.</p>
