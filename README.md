# Fundamentals of Digital Fabrication

This repo is the documentation of my Fundamentals of Digital Fabrication class, where we learned about the basics of 2D and 3D Design, Laser Cutting, 3D Printing, Electronics Productions and Design and Embedded Programming with Input and Output Devices. We then had to use all these skills in a Final Project.
